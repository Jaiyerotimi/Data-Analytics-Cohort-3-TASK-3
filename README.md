## AVERAGEIFS 

To calculate the average revenue generated from sales in “Paseo”, I used the AVERAGEIFS Function =AVERAGEIF (range, criteria, [average_range]) With J2:J701 as the range, "Paseo" as the criteria and [C2:C701] as [average_range]

 ## COUNTIFS 
 To return the number of sales of Government and MidMarket, I used the COUNTIFS Function, =COUNTIFS, I calculated each individually and added the 2 ranges together. (A2:A701:A3)+(A2:A701:A4)
